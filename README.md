# About

### Objective

Synchronization of workouts from endomondo to strava.

### Why?

Endomondo will die till the end of 2020 (Press F to pay respect)

### Why not tapiriik?

Tapiriik doesn't work, google says that not just for meâ€¦

# Booting up

1. Rename/copy .env.sample to .env. ```cp .env.sample .env```
2. Fill with your endomondo data email/pass
3. Set start backup and end backup date
4. Run ```make all```

# Environments

```
ENDOMONDO_EMAIL=your@email
ENDOMONDO_PASS=xyz
```

### Strava OAuth2.0 client id and client secret

STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=abcd
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=ABCD
```

### Export/import

```
END_AT=2020-11-01
```

Format in which workouts will be downloaded from endomondo. 
Possible values <GPX, TCX>.

- export: runs only export from endomondo
- import: runs only import to strava

```
// Does full synchro
STEP=export,import
// Only export
STEP=export
// Only import
STEP=import
```

# Used API's

### Strava

For uploading to strava is used official strava API/v3, which is documented here: https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/.

### Endomondo

Endomondo doesn't have official API thus it's used session API from www, thus email/pass is required.

# Q

1. Does it duplicate my workouts.

It tracks in sqlite what was imported, and what not, so shouldn't. Strava seems to have also a security check for uploading same workouts many times. 

# TODO

1. Saving access token and refresh token for strava to not ask for code every time app is running,
2. Dockerize it,
3. Verification if import ended
